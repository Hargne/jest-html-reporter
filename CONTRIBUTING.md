# Contributing

So you want to contribute to the project? **How lovely!** Here are a few things to keep in mind when working with the project:

## Code Quality

The format of the code is handled by the use of [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier). When coding, make sure that your IDE has access to use Prettier to format the code before committing the code to the repository.

### Testing

This project is using [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) for testing and the test specifications should be placed within the _/test_ folder.
All functionality should have it's use-cases somewhat thoroughly tested (best sentence ever, thank you very much).

## Pull Requests

When you are done with your contribution, issue a pull request. The project maintainers will have a look at it as soon as possible!

## Have fun

🎺 This is the most important thing of all.
